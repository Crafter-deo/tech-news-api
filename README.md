# TechTimes News API

The TechTimes News API is a web scraping tool that gathers the latest news stories from various technology news websites. This API provides a convenient and easy-to-use way to access up-to-date news articles in one place, without the need to visit multiple websites.

Well, I already did something similar in python, but I decided to rewrite it in Go so I can learn a thing or two

You can find the python version [here](https://github.com/Crafter-deo/tech-news-feed/tree/main/v2-api)
